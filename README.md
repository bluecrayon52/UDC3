# UDC3
User Data Clustering for Census and Consensus:

This is a subsystem for a Political Representation Software System that allows administrators to filter HashMaps of users 
based on various demographic configurations for political analysis. 

Additionally, the UDC3 subsystem enables administrators to calculate and assign consensus scores to congress members based on
their voting record and how it compares to public sentiment in their respective district.
